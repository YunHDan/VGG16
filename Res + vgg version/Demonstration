  This is a new version of vgg.
  I add the idea of resnet into vgg model.
  What needed to be noted is that vgg_resnet_train is very similar to my_vgg_train, just has a difference in epoch.
  In my_vgg_train, epoch is 20, because the epoch is enough to train a complete weight param.
  In vgg_resnet_train, epoch is 30 or 40, even 50, which is decided by yourself.But in my computer, i choose 40.
  In contrast, old vgg model for train needs 921 seconds in 20 epoch, and gets 93% accuracy.
  The new model, it takes 943 seconds in the same 20 epoch, and gets 92% accuracy.
  To be honest, my experience depend on one RTX 3050.
  For complete model, 40 epoch need 1883 seconds, however, the accuracy reach 96%.
  It is important to note that add resnet's idea into vgg may make the training speed lower or the accuracy lower, but the most significant contribution is that 
we can make sure our net would not occur weight explosion or weight disappear.
