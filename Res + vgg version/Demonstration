This is a new version of vgg.
I add the idea of resnet into vgg model.Undeniably, the speed and accuracy has been greetly improved.
What needed to be noted is that vgg_resnet_train is very similar to my_vgg_train, just has a difference in epoch.
In my_vgg_train, epoch is 20, because the epoch is enough to train a complete weight param.
In vgg_resnet_train, epoch is 30 or 40, even 50, which is decided by yourself.But in my computer, i choose 40.
In contrast, old vgg model for train needs ......minutes in 20 epoch, and gets ...... accuracy.
However, in my new model, it just takes 946.5819034576416 seconds in the same 20 epoch, and gets 92% accuracy.
To be honest, my experience depend on one RTX 3050.
For complete model, 40 epoch need 1883.2481775283813 seconds, however, the accuracy can reach 96%, which is old model cannot beat.
